### Problem Statement
Sales manager wants a dashboard to track how sales agents are doing. He want it to be comparable where he selects a time frame this year and he wants sales data for same period last year.<br> Additionally he wants a breakdown of sales:  
*	Per category  
*	Subcategory  
*	Top 5 Performing products  

 **Given the parameters of start date and end date of sales, we filter data only to reflect trends and patterns in the selected timeframe.**

### These are the following techniques used as a part of analysis
  * **Donut Chart** - to plot different categories
  * **Line Chart** - to capture trends and patterns of sales in selected period
  * **Horizontal Bars** - to show sales by Sales Agent
  * **Action button** - to show only top 5 products(by sales) data belonging to certain filter(eg, Sales Agent)
  * Created **sales breakdown structure** based on the selected Sales Agent to show summary of sales done by that Agent showing sales last year, sales this year and growth percentage.
