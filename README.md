## 1. Analysis of Sales of a Supermarket chain([link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sowmya.pallempati/viz/SuperstoreSalesDashboard_16787632174850/salesDashboard?publish=yes))
### Problem Statement
>Sales manager wants a dashboard to track how sales agents are doing. He want it to be comparable where he selects a time frame this year and he wants sales data for same period last year.<br> Additionally he wants a breakdown of sales:<br>
>*	Per category<br>
>*	Subcategory<br>
>*	Top 5 Performing products<br>

## Given the parameters of start date and end date of sales, we filter data only to reflect trends and patterns in the selected timeframe.

## These are the following techniques used as a part of analysis
  * Donut Chart - to plot different categories
  * Line Chart - to capture trends and patterns of sales in selected period
  * Horizontal Bars - to show sales by Sales Agent
  * Action button - to show only top 5 products(by sales) data belonging to certain filter(eg, Sales Agent)
  * Created sales breakdown structure based on the selected Sales Agent to show summary of sales done by that Agent showing sales last year, sales this year and growth percentage.
